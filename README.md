## What is Trivia Tracker?

Trivia tracker is a webpage that helps pub trivia players keep track of their teams progress. A team can document their wins, winnings,
and history. A team member can have a role of Captain, Reporter, Member, or Guest. Each role can do a different job for the team. For
example, a Captain can add events to the teams history and change the teams settings, whereas a Reporter can only add events to the teams history.

## Technologies Used

Trivia Tracker client was created using ReactJs framework. The API was created using NodeJs and Express


## Deploying
